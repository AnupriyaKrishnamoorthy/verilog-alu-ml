# verilog-alu-ml #100DaysofVLSIAI


This repository contains a simple **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** designed in **Verilog**, along with a **Python integration** layer that reads simulation outputs and analyzes them for potential machine learning applications like delay prediction.

## 🔧 ALU Features

- **Operands**: 8-bit input operands `a` and `b`
- **Opcode**: 3-bit operation selector
- **Operations Supported**:
  - `000`: Addition
  - `001`: Subtraction
  - `010`: AND
  - `011`: OR
  - `100`: XOR
  - `101`: NOT A
  - `110`: A << 1 (Shift left)
  - `111`: A >> 1 (Shift right)

## 🧪 Testbench

- Designed using `initial` block with `$fwrite` to export simulation results to `alu_output.txt`.
- Format: `a=00000101, b=00000011, opcode=010, out=00000001`

---

## 🐍 Python Integration

- Reads `alu_output.txt`
- Converts binary strings to decimal
- Processes data for potential ML tasks using `pandas` and `scikit-learn` (to be added in later phases)

---

## 🚀 Goals

- ✅ Complete ALU design and testbench (Verilog)
- ✅ Export simulation output
- 🔄 Analyze with Python (in progress)
- 🔮 Build a regression model to **predict delay** based on ALU inputs

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Solidify understanding of **Verilog modules**, simulation, and testbenches
- Practice **data export from HDL to external tools**
- Bridge VLSI and AI using **Python + Machine Learning**
